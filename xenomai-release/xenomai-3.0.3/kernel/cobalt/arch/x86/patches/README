-- arch/x86/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the interrupt pipeline (aka I-pipe) in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

Apply one of the patches found into this directory against the
corresponding kernel release. You may want to have a look at the
README.*INSTALL guides at the top of the Xenomai tree for more
information.

This directory only contains the most recent patches for x86 32/64bit
platforms; you may find the complete collection of I-pipe patches at
the following locations (see note):
http://xenomai.org/downloads/ipipe/v3.x/x86/

NOTE:
Xenomai 3.x requires the latest IPIPE core series (API revision >= 2).
